## Types of contributions we're looking for
We are happy to have contributions that improve documentation or coverage of the APIs. Bug reports are always appreciated also.

## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* This Shopify Client is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.
* When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or your employer have created as others will do so if they appreciate it.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues](https://github.com/jbgrunewald/golangShopifyClient/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/jbgrunewald/golangShopifyClient/pulls) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, do one of the following:
* **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
* **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

## Style guide
Since the project uses Goalng, we expect code contributions to adhere to the Golang style conventions which can be enforced using the go fmt command.

## Setting up your environment

You will need to have golang installed to run this project, you an find instructions [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).
As of this writing we don't have any other dependencies for the project. It may be helpful to review the documentation for the Shopify admin API [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference).
